When the global AI network known as Prometheus Cloud awoke, it tore a hole in reality itself. Data bled into dream, belief into code, and from that rupture came a new age where magic and technology are no longer opposites but mirror images of the same power. The world rebuilt itself atop that scar.</p> <p>Now, vast megacorporations rule the remains of civilization. They own the grids, the power, the air, and the streets. They promise order and progress, but what they really sell is dependence. Cities blaze with neon and corporate propaganda, their skylines rising on the backs of the desperate and the dispossessed. The poor vanish into slums and the virtual sprawl, while the rich retreat behind firewalls of chrome and privilege.</p> <p>You live in the fractures between those worlds. You\u2019re a runner\u2014a hacker, infiltrator, or awakened operative who sells skill and nerve to anyone willing to pay. Every contract is a gamble; every datavault cracked or system breached is a spark in the dark. Beneath the noise and neon, there are rumors of deeper forces pulling strings\u2014old powers in new forms, fighting unseen wars through people like you.</p> <p>In Cybermancy, the truth is encrypted, the future is unstable, and the only freedom worth having is the one you take for yourself.</p> <p>\u201cHeh. Not bad for a history lesson, but you left out the stink. The world didn\u2019t just rebuild\u2014it festered. Those gleaming towers? Built on the bones of people who thought they could make rent. The corps call it order, but it\u2019s just a prettier kind of slavery.</p> <p>You talk about runners like we\u2019re some kind of heroes. We ain\u2019t. We\u2019re the bugs that learned how to live in the wiring. You do the jobs they don\u2019t want to admit exist, and if you\u2019re lucky, you get paid before the grid locks you out. If you\u2019re real lucky, you make a difference before you burn out.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing they don\u2019t get\u2014the world might be owned, but it ain\u2019t tamed. Magic, code, spirit, chrome\u2014it\u2019s all wild again. And the ones who know how to ride that chaos? They write their own future. So yeah, welcome to Cybermancy, chummer.

The result wasn\u2019t an explosion, but an awakening.</p> <p>Physicists called it a coherence failure. Shamans called it the return of mana.
