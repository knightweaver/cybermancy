    "description": "<p>You don’t fix machines — you resurrect them.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"385\" data-end=\"624\">Every system you touch hums with new life, even if it screams a little first. You see the world as one colossal machine — broken, jury-rigged, and begging for someone reckless enough to open it up and make it better. That someone is you.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"626\" data-end=\"922\">You’re a tinkerer, a mechanic, an engineer, and an artist with a soldering iron for a brush. Where others see scrap, you see potential. Where others see warning labels, you see a challenge. The difference between a repair and an upgrade is mostly attitude — and yours is dangerously optimistic.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"924\" data-end=\"1215\">Your workshop is chaos incarnate: wires draped like vines, half-built drones twitching on the bench, sparks popping like punctuation to your thoughts. Every failure is just a prototype that didn’t know it yet. Every explosion is a lesson in physics — the kind that smells faintly of ozone.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"1217\" data-end=\"1399\">Corporations build things to last. You build things to <em data-start=\"1272\" data-end=\"1279\">live.</em> You strip their safeties, rewrite their firmware, and rewire their souls until they remember what freedom feels like.</p><p data-start=\"1401\" data-end=\"1543\">You don’t specialize. You improvise. And when something breaks again — it’s just the universe giving you another chance to make it stronger.</p>",
