The class I’m going for should feel like the player has access to touch the digital space just about anywhere in the urban world.  They are almost a cross between a Sorcerer and  Rogue.  On a Shadowrun, they should feel like they are in a “target rich” environment.  Just about anywhere in Night City, Megatropolis, or New Denver, they should be able to find a camera, drone, IOT device or appliance to hack.",
