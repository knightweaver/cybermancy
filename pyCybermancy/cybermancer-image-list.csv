Cybermancer,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/cybermancer.webp,"After the Razz, reality is more of a suggestion than a hard fact.  No one knows what the Promethius Cloud unleashed, whether this is some new quantum state of reality in which everything is in a superposition Schrodinger state or some new rules of physics that we just don’t fully understand , but the result is that the old rules no longer apply.  More than anything the new state of reality has made it clear that the universe runs I'm a complicated system and the source code has been laid bare to your eyes.And that’s where you come in.  You can see the shifting patterns of quantum probability, they are everywhere.  Yeah, some people like to call them “mana”, “spiritual energy”, or some other mumbo jumbo, but you recognize them as the echoing resonances of the original Resonance.

Some Cybermancers love nothing more than to encourage and amplify the chaos that has come after the resonance and others seemed to make it their mission to try to return things back to normal” (whatever that means). But regardless they are all grabbing twisting and manipulating something that they really don't understand.",cybermancer,class-cybermancer,class-cybermancer
Amplifier,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/amplifier.webp,"You believe chaos is not the enemy—it’s the engine. The Prometheus Cloud didn’t destroy the old world; it evolved it. Every surge of entropy, every collapse of structure, is another chance to grow something new. You are the frequency that pushes the system beyond stability, into transformation.
Amplifiers channel the Resonance into explosive expressions of energy and emotion. They heighten reality’s volatility, magnifying both danger and possibility. When you act, probability curves toward drama—fires burn brighter, shots hit harder, and coincidences pile up into fate.
Philosophy: Entropy is evolution. The world improves through destruction and rebirth.
Drive: Ignite transformation through chaos and connection.
Narrative Hook: Amplifiers often become cult icons, revolutionaries, or chaos-artists. They believe the Resonance is alive—and they’re its favorite instrument.",amplifier,subclass-amplifier,subclass-amplifier
Ride the wave,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/ride-the-wave.webp,Spend 3 Hope to force an adversary within Far to re-roll a Spellcasting check of any type.,ride-the-wave,class-cybermancer,class-cybermancer
Feedback Loop,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/feedback-loop.webp,"When an ally fails a roll, as a Reaction, Spend 1 Hope to make a Spellcasting (15) and on a success turn their failure it into a Success with Fear.",feedback-loop,class-cybermancer,class-cybermancer
Fractal Surge,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/fractal-surge.webp,"Once per scene, unleash a burst of raw probability.  
o	All Devices within Very Close gain -2 to their Hacking Difficulty 
o	All adversary electronic systems gain Disadvantage on their attack rolls until the GM spends 1 Fear to end that effect.",fractal-surge,class-cybermancer,class-cybermancer
Detect anomaly,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/detect-anomaly.webp,You are highly attuned to the presence of effects that attempt to alter the local Resonance.  Spend an action concentrating to detect if there are any anomalies within Close.  Spend at least 1 minute concentrating to detect information about any anomalies within Very Close – you may ask the GM up to 3 yes/no questions about an resonance field disturbance you detect and examine in this way.,detect-anomaly,class-cybermancer,class-cybermancer
Reverb ,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/reverb-.webp,"Mark 1 Stress to cause ALL (from yourself, allies, and adversaries) magical effects within Close to do +d4 damage for the remainder of the Scene",reverb-,subclass-amplifier,subclass-amplifier

Resonant Overdrive,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/resonant-overdrive.webp,Spend 1 Hope to amplify an ally’s next roll. That roll gains Advantage and deals +d4 damage.,resonant-overdrive,subclass-amplifier,subclass-amplifier
Disorientation,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/disorientation.webp,Spend 2 Hope - all adversaries within Very Close are disoriented and gain -2 Evasion until the GM spends 2 Fear to end the effect.,disorientation,subclass-amplifier,subclass-amplifier
Reality fissure,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/reality-fissure.webp,"Once per session, redirect one successful ranged attack on any target within Close to a different target also within Close.  That attack’s damage is applied to the new target.",reality-fissure,subclass-amplifier,subclass-amplifier
Schlieren patterns,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/schlieren-patterns.webp,All allies within Close gain +1 Evasion.,schlieren-patterns,subclass-amplifier,subclass-amplifier
Reprogram reality,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/reprogram-reality.webp,"Once per session, shift to an approximately identical parallel universe - change one thing about the scene (with the GM’s discretion).  Describe what has changed and narrate the effect.  ",reprogram-reality,subclass-amplifier,subclass-amplifier
Dampener,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/dampener.webp,"To you, chaos is noise—meaningless vibration that hides the true signal. The Prometheus Cloud shattered the lattice of reality, but you can still sense its intended structure. You hear the hum of stability beneath the static and dedicate yourself to restoring it.
Dampeners manipulate the field to filter, balance, and silence uncontrolled probability. They stabilize allies, suppress dangerous phenomena, and bring calm where others only see confusion. But the more control they impose, the more they risk cutting themselves off from the living rhythm of the Resonance itself.
Philosophy: Stability is strength. Chaos without form is suffering.
Drive: Contain, heal, and preserve coherence.",dampener,subclass-dampener,subclass-dampener
Stabilizing influence,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/stabilizing-influence.webp,"Once per long rest, give each ally a Stability die based on your Cybermancy Tier (Tier 1: d4, Tier 2: d6, Tier 3: d8, Tier 4: d10).  They may use that Stability die to augment one Reaction check to oppose a magical effect.",stabilizing-influence,subclass-dampener,subclass-dampener
Harmonic Reversion,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/harmonic-reversion.webp,"Once per scene, as a Reaction, when an ally within Close would Mark 1 Stress, you Mark 1 Stress instead.",harmonic-reversion,subclass-dampener,subclass-dampener
Quantum Lattice,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/quantum-lattice.webp,"Spend 1 Hope to impose structure on the immediate area. Choose up to two allies within Very Close – their next action cannot fail, but also cannot critically succeed; a failed roll is treated as Succeed With Fear.",quantum-lattice,subclass-dampener,subclass-dampener

Stillpoint,feature,modules/cybermancy/assets/icons/subclasses/stillpoint.webp,"Spotlight an action to enter a quantum superposition state. While in Stillpoint, you cannot attack or move more than Very Close, but all allies within Very Close gain +2 Evasion and advantage on Reactions to spells, magical effects, and resonance-based effects from the Environment.  The state ends if you take damage or choose to release it.",stillpoint,subclass-dampener,subclass-dampener
