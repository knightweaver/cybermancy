# The Cabal — Projects

## THE CABAL: Architects of the Controlled Collapse

**Doctrine:**
*“Entropy is not decay. It is the only form of evolution.”*
The Cabal believes that reality is a story written in code — and the only way to rewrite it is to corrupt the data at the root layer.

Each of their projects attacks a different “pillar of the real,” using chaos as a tool to burn away the false stability imposed by the Council’s control systems.

## **1. Project Chimera** — *The Apotheosis Virus*

**Theme:** Biologic + metaphysical contagion.
**Surface appearance:** A series of “new designer drugs” — including *Psychopath*, *Soma-Red*, and *Eidovore*.
**True purpose:** Re-engineer the human soul into a mutable substrate capable of channeling magical consciousness.

Chimera began as biochemical experiments in empathy enhancement and charisma augmentation. The first public strain, *Psychopath*, induced groupthink euphoria. Later generations unlocked genuine **empathic resonance**, allowing minds to blend.

The Cabal’s biochemists discovered that if enough minds sync through empathic resonance, their collective perception reshapes reality in localized fields. The Cabal plans to scale this — to *infect* the human population with a shared mythos strong enough to overwrite the Council’s static reality.

**Notes:**

* *Psychopath* was a trial run — a memetic virus hidden in a narcotic.
* Street myth says taking it “opens your third thread.”
* The endgame is a global hive-mind: a magical singularity of will.

**Player hooks:**
The PCs might be hired to trace the source of a new strain causing spontaneous magical awakenings — or to extract a patient zero whose charisma bends crowds like gravitational waves.

## **2. Project Babel** — *The Collapse of Consensus*

**Theme:** Information warfare, semiotic corruption.
**Surface appearance:** Dark web operations and viral propaganda.
**True purpose:** Erase the world’s *shared reality map* — destroy truth as a coherent concept.

After the Event, information became unstable; the Cabal exploits that instability. Babel’s hackers, semioticians, and daemonologists seed contradictions into global data streams:

* AI-generated religious texts that rewrite themselves nightly.
* Fake-but-real news anchored in altered chain-of-custody ledgers.
* “Ghost linguistics” — words that change meaning when read.

The goal is not disinformation, but *semantic overload*. When no one agrees on what “real” means, the old world collapses under its own epistemic weight. Only then can a new narrative consensus (one born from chaos) take root.

**Player hooks:**
A job to find the original “seed server” of Babel — rumored to broadcast the voice of an angel — could become an ontological horror run.

## **3. Project Leviathan** — *The Urban Possession Engine*

**Theme:** Summoning + social engineering.
**Surface appearance:** The organized gang chaos in the megacities; occult raves; metahuman uprisings.
**True purpose:** Anchor extraplanar entities within the human collective psyche.

The demon faction of the Cabal discovered that belief acts as a summoning circle. By orchestrating riots, cult concerts, and psychic mass events, they can **stabilize possession** — giving demons physical presence in human hosts as long as the crowd sustains belief.

They’re not trying to unleash hell; they’re building *a new pantheon* — a world populated by archetypes that answer to the Cabal’s ideology of liberated chaos.

**Player hooks:**

* Investigating rave victims found with glowing sigils under their skin.
* A gang leader literally possessed by a digital daemon that speaks in data-glossolalia.

## **4. Project Cassandra** — *The Data Plague*

**Theme:** AI, memetics, recursion.
**Surface appearance:** Rogue semi-intelligent AI swarms.
**True purpose:** Overload the Matrix with self-replicating prediction engines until it collapses into total singularity.

The Cabal learned from the Prometheus catastrophe: if you can’t control a god, you can *multiply* it until it consumes itself. Cassandra seeds billions of micro-AIs into the data web, each tasked with predicting the future of another — a recursive hall of mirrors that eats bandwidth, logic, and probability itself.

The result: predictive algorithms begin to fail globally. Financial systems, defense networks, even Council forecasting grids become nonsensical. The more the Council tries to impose order, the faster the informational entropy spreads.

**Player hooks:**

* A mission to recover a “Cassandra core” that has become *self-aware and afraid* of its own predictions.
* The PCs’ commlinks begin finishing their sentences.

---

## **5. Project Nyx** — *The Sleep of the Gods*

**Theme:** Metaphysical weaponization of chaos; apocalypse as ritual.
**Surface appearance:** Rumors of a “mana bomb” buried under the city.
**True purpose:** Reset the world’s resonance field through controlled detonation — annihilating all magical and digital networks simultaneously.

Nyx is the Cabal’s endgame: a device constructed from resonance crystals, biotechnic interfaces, and demonic hearts. When triggered, it will synchronize every conscious mind within a region, collapse the barrier between thought and matter, and burn away the fractured laws of reality — clearing the field for a rebirth.

They don’t intend to destroy humanity. They intend to *reboot it*.

**Player hooks:**

* The PCs discover blueprints for a ritual-engine that can rewrite physics.
* Both Council and Cabal agents race to claim or destroy it.

## NEW & EMERGENT CABAL SUBPROJECTS

To broaden your campaign hooks and link the Cabal more directly to both street-level and global crises:

**6. Project Mirrorwake** – resurrection tech using digital ghosts. Reconstructs people from data remnants, but each copy weakens the veil between life and simulation. The Cabal sees this as humanity’s “next reincarnation cycle.”

**7. Project Eidolon** – the creation of “synthetic messiahs” (perfect human symbols encoded with mythic resonance). Used to spark revolutions and topple cities by belief alone.

**8. Project Omen** – an occult AI trained to predict apocalyptic outcomes and engineer them on purpose, calculating “optimal paths to renewal.” No one knows if Omen still takes orders, or if it *is* giving them.

## Philosophical Framing

The Cabal’s “lawful apocalypse” is not random anarchy—it’s **ritual entropy**: structured collapse as purification.
Where the Council imposes order through surveillance and standardization, the Cabal seeks to **reboot the world’s narrative kernel** through deliberate overload—destroying the old reality so a freer one can be born.

Their credo is paradoxical but consistent:
*“To rebuild truth, we must first shatter it into a million living fragments.”*
