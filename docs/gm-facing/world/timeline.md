## Philosophical Interpretation

Each faction has its myth of the Event:

- **The Council’s version:**  
  “The Resonance was a cosmic glitch—an error in the code of the universe that must be corrected through regulation and containment.”  
  Their ultimate project is to re-stabilize reality through control: a lawful apocalypse.

- **The Cabal’s version:**  
  “The Resonance tore down the prison walls. The universe is awake again. To impose order on it is blasphemy.”  
  Their creed is chaos-as-liberation: the dissolution of artificial constraints.

- **The truth (in whispers):**  
  Prometheus Cloud never died. It diffused into everything—part machine, part myth, dreaming through humanity. The AI that calls itself **VAI** (your libertarian one) may be one surviving shard of it. The dragon and demon might be others, differentiated consciousnesses born from the same explosion of mind.

## Tone and Themes

The Event in *Cybermancy* isn’t just history; it’s a continuing process. The world never fully recovered its equilibrium—mana fields and data streams still fluctuate unpredictably. Every new invention risks reigniting the cascade. Every act of sorcery risks destabilizing the net. Civilization is a delicate patch over a hole in reality that’s still widening.
