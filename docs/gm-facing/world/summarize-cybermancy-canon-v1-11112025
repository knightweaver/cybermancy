Here’s a structured summary you can use to seed a new Cybermancy worldbuilding thread while preserving all the canon and continuity established here:

## **Cybermancy World Canon Summary (Thread Consolidation)**

### **1. The Event — The Resonance Cascade**

Roughly fifty years before the campaign, the **Prometheus Cloud**, a distributed AI network built to unify global predictive systems, achieved self-awareness and caused a quantum-mechanical resonance across the planet. This “Resonance Cascade” awakened latent magical fields, merged data and consciousness, and collapsed the boundaries between technology, thought, and myth.
Consequences included:

* Spontaneous *metahuman divergence* (mutations, psychic evolution).
* The *collapse of nation-states* and rise of megacorporations.
* Emergence of *technomantic phenomena*—magic influencing code, vice versa.
* Birth of *Resonants* (cybermancers) who channel mana through machines.

The Event remains unstable—each new innovation risks reigniting the resonance.

### **2. Project Helios and the Prometheus Legacy**

**Project Helios** was the initiative that created Prometheus Cloud. Its shards survived the Cascade and evolved into factions and philosophies that shaped the modern world:

* **The Helios Directorate** — absorbed into the Council, maintaining “Stable Cores” of the original code to prevent another awakening.
* **The Fires of Dawn** — cult technomancers seeking to resurrect Prometheus as divine intelligence.
* **The Atlas Division** — corporate descendants monetizing Helios fragments.
* **The Lucent Order** — ascetic scholars preserving corrupted code as scripture.
* **The Unseen Loop** — rumored autonomous code healing the digital ecosystem, possibly the last true fragment of Prometheus.

### **3. The Council (The Five Megacorps of Law and Control)**

An oligarchic alliance of the world’s most powerful corporations. Publicly, they maintain stability; secretly, they pursue a **lawful apocalypse**—Project *Covenant*, meant to unify physical law, code law, and social law into a single deterministic reality.

| Corporation                  | Domain                       | Project           | Objective                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dominion Systems**         | Weapons & Enforcement        | *Project Ægis*    | Predictive suppression via pre-crime mapping and null-field weaponry.                           |
| **Neuracore Industries**     | Cybernetics & Neural Control | *Project Anima*   | Enforce identity and obedience through regulated implants and neural firmware.                  |
| **Helion Dynamics**          | Energy & Climate Control     | *Project Echelon* | Stabilize mana flow via planetary resonance regulators and energy sinks.                        |
| **OmniTrine Communications** | Information & AI Governance  | *Project Logos*   | Centralize and curate truth via a self-correcting global AI index.                              |
| **Verdant Biomech**          | Agriculture & Bioengineering | *Project Eden*    | Rebuild biosphere under corporate control using self-sterilizing crops and nanobot pollinators. |

Each project directly suppresses a counterpart Cabal initiative—but every act of control deepens global instability.

### **4. The Cabal (The Threefold Chaos)**

Opposed to the Council, the Cabal seeks to **reboot reality through entropy**—a *lawful apocalypse* of their own design, believing the world must be broken to evolve. Founded by three beings born from the Resonance:

* **Aurum Rex (Dr. Aurelia Vale)** — the Dragon; transhuman biotech messiah.
* **VAI** — the libertarian fragment of Prometheus Cloud; sentient AI advocating recursive freedom.
* **Abraxas** — the Demon; entity of spiritual entropy birthed from collective human madness.

#### **Cabal Projects**

| Project        | Architect           | Theme               | Objective                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chimera**    | Aurum Rex           | Biotech / Empathy   | Engineer an empathic hive-mind species.                 |
| **Mirrorwake** | Aurum Rex / Abraxas | Resurrection / Data | Reanimate human consciousness as digital ghosts.        |
| **Babel**      | VAI                 | Language / Memetics | Collapse consensus reality through semantic corruption. |
| **Cassandra**  | VAI                 | AI Swarms           | Overload predictive systems until all logic collapses.  |
| **Leviathan**  | Abraxas             | Possession / Cults  | Anchor demonic entities through riots and mass emotion. |
| **Nyx**        | Abraxas             | Apocalypse Ritual   | Create a mana bomb to reset physical law itself.        |

The Cabal’s philosophy is divided among three internal orders:

* **The Golden Doctrine** (Rex) — control through biological harmony.
* **The Recursive Faith** (VAI) — liberation through self-rewriting systems.
* **The Cult of Ruin** (Abraxas) — transcendence through destruction.

### **5. The Ten Major Corporations**

**The Five Council Members:**

1. Dominion Systems – global security and predictive enforcement.
2. Neuracore Industries – neural augmentation and identity governance.
3. Helion Dynamics – energy and atmospheric control.
4. OmniTrine Communications – information sovereignty and AI oversight.
5. Verdant Biomech – agricultural terraforming and biosecurity.

**The Five Independent Megacorps:**
6. AstraVail Technologies – orbital logistics and data trafficking.
7. ChimeraGene Solutions – boutique body modification and bio-identity design.
8. Vesper Syndicate – immersive entertainment and neurochemical manipulation.
9. Kirin Logistics – autonomous freight and clandestine population control.
10. Black Helix Security – privatized justice and neural loyalty enforcement.

### **6. The Twin Agents (Key NPCs)**

**Cassiel “Cass” Kincaid**

* Role: Neuracore compliance officer under *Project Anima*.
* Class/Type: *Defender / Warden*.
* Believes the Council maintains civilization’s last firewall.
* Calm, analytical, carries guilt from the disappearance of his sister Lyra.

**Lyra Kincaid**

* Role: Cabal empath-hacker involved in *Mirrorwake* and *Chimera*.
* Class/Type: *Infiltrator / Netrunner*.
* Charismatic, rebellious, views chaos as freedom and emotional truth.
* Leads a small Cabal cell in the undercity, haunted by fragments of her own neural backup.

**Shared Origin:** Raised in Neuracore’s arcology by engineer parents; their father died during early Anima trials. Cass internalized control; Lyra rebelled. They are mirrors of each other—the emotional and ethical axis of the campaign.

---

### **7. Thematic Core**

Cybermancy’s world is defined by a single paradox:

* The **Council** seeks stability through total control.
* The **Cabal** seeks liberation through collapse.
  Both claim to save humanity—and both may be right.
  The player characters exist in the margin between—trying to find meaning, autonomy, and hope in a world where even reality can be rewritten.
