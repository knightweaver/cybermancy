# Cybermancy — GM Guide

---

### Initial Concept Summary

The world of *Cybermancy* sits at a fragile equilibrium between **the Council** (Law) and **the Cabal** (Chaos). Neither side is wholly evil — one seeks order through domination and control; the other seeks freedom through dissolution and entropy. The player characters inhabit the narrow trench between these two forces — street-level operatives, runners, and would-be heroes trying to carve out meaning and justice in a world where both cosmic order and chaos would consume them.

Your current arc has nine key narrative strata:

1. **Catalyst rumors** — the strange new drugs, chipware, and metahumans that mark the emergence of something world-shifting.
2. **The Threefold Cabal** — dragon, AI, and demon—each a facet of Chaos with their own logic and appetites.
3. **The Council’s technocratic regime** — five megacorps representing material domains: weapons, cybernetics, energy, data, and food.
4. **The Law–Chaos axis** as the world’s central moral tension.
5. **Corporate manipulations** (propaganda, pandemics, surveillance).
6. **Cabalic counter-operations** (AI plagues, cult drugs, ritual bombs).
7. **Street-level threads** — protests, raves, gang wars, metahuman rumors.
8. **Personal anchors** — the idealistic corporate insider and her rebel sister.
9. **Player motivation** — the party’s search for agency and moral clarity amid systemic corruption and magical corruption.

### Next Steps for Ideation

Here’s how we can structure this thread going forward:

~~1. **World Foundations** – Pin down the “Event” that birthed this era of magic-tech convergence. Was it accidental, cosmic, engineered?~~
2. **The Council** – Flesh out the five megacorps, their internal politics, and how their monopolies map onto global infrastructure.
3. **The Cabal** – Define the dragon, the AI, and the demon more fully: their names, motives, and how their philosophies of chaos differ.
4. **The City** – Anchor the player’s experience in a primary urban setting: geography, neighborhoods, cultural texture, and media.
5. **The Street Hooks** – Expand each of your existing “projects” into playable arcs with moral choices, infiltration points, and NPCs.
6. **The Twin Agents** – Deepen the siblings’ story — their relationship, where players meet them, how their allegiances evolve.
7. **Mystic-Technological Themes** – Explore how magic, biotech, and data weave together; what “cybermancy” *means* in-world.

Would you like me to begin by **fleshing out the Threefold Cabal** (dragon, AI, demon) — giving each a personality, human alias, and operational style — or would you prefer I first **define the post-Event world and how magic returned to it**? Either one forms the foundation of the tone and mythic logic of the setting.
