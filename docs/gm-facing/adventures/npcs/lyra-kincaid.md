#### **Background**

Lyra grew up in the same sterile tower as her brother but saw its beauty as a cage. She was a child prodigy in neural design and empathy modeling—her early research data was stolen by Neuracore and used in the first *Anima harmonization protocols*.

When she protested, they claimed she was emotionally unstable. Neuracore forcibly “corrected” her—implanting an empathy dampener.
She fled.
Years later, she woke up in the undercity among anarchic hackers and cultic artists, drawn to the whispers of a being named *Abraxas* that appeared in her dreams.

Abraxas didn’t demand obedience. It promised transcendence.
Lyra learned to see code, memory, and soul as one continuum. She began crafting “mirror ghosts”—digital echoes of the dead—to expose how the Council’s neural control erases personhood.

Now she leads a cell of empathic hackers, using Cabal tech to awaken others’ suppressed feelings—risking possession and psychic feedback every time she connects.

#### **Why She Joined the Cabal**

Lyra sees the Council’s order as the death of humanity’s spirit. She believes chaos isn’t destruction but *healing through feeling*—the breaking of all numbness. To her, the Cabal’s “lawful apocalypse” isn’t apocalypse at all—it’s rebirth.

She doesn’t serve Abraxas as a god; she treats it as an ally in the same struggle: *to make the world dream again.*

#### **Involvement**

* **Projects:** *Mirrorwake* and *Chimera*.
* **Responsibility:** Developing viral empathy software that reawakens suppressed memories and emotional bonds.
* **Moral Strain:** She learns her neural signature is embedded in Neuracore’s firmware updates—her consciousness harvested without consent.

#### **How Players Meet Her**

The PCs encounter Lyra during an extraction job—retrieving a rogue AI fragment (*Mirrorwake-9*). She’s charming, impulsive, and burning with belief. When the team delivers the AI to her contact, she reveals the devastating truth: *Mirrorwake-9* is her lost consciousness—a backup copy made before her augmentation was ripped out.

Lyra sees the PCs as proof that free will still exists, and will try to recruit them into her Cabal cell—but she also warns them: “Every choice you make leaves a ghost. Be ready to meet yours.”
