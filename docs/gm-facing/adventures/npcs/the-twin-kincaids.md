### **The Divergence**

Cass and Lyra’s paths diverged at a single moment—when their father, **Dr. Maren Kincaid**, volunteered for an early *Project Anima* trial. The test fried his neural pathways; Neuracore covered it up as suicide.

Cass accepted the corporate narrative—believing sacrifice was noble.
Lyra dug into the data—and found the Council’s fingerprints.
That was the day she vanished into the undercity.

Both are driven by grief for the same loss, but they processed it in opposite directions:

* Cass built walls of control to keep the world from breaking again.
* Lyra tore down walls to stop anyone from being owned again.

They are mirrors—each carrying a fragment of the other’s truth.

### **Narrative Function**

The siblings embody the **bridge between cosmic and human stakes**:

* Cass’s loyalty can bring the PCs into the Council’s inner sanctum.
* Lyra’s rebellion opens doors to the Cabal’s secret temples.
* Their eventual confrontation becomes the **emotional climax** of the campaign’s middle arc—when the PCs must decide which version of “saving the world” they believe in.

Both have the potential to die for their cause—or to change it.
