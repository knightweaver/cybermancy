#### **Background**

Cass was born in the arcology of *Eidolon City*, a controlled megastructure owned by Neuracore Industries. His parents were mid-tier bioengineers working on *neural stability* projects. From an early age, Cass believed in the Council’s doctrine that *order is compassion*: only through control can suffering be minimized. He grew up idolizing the clean, efficient perfection of Neuracore’s cybernetic order—safe, predictable, and purposeful.

He excelled in the academy, was fitted with early prototype neural augments, and quickly rose as a *behavioral compliance officer* for Neuracore’s implant divisions. His job: monitor cognitive stability among early Anima subjects, ensuring that personality drift stayed within corporate tolerance.

But he carries quiet guilt. One subject—his own sister—vanished from his logs years ago.

#### **Why He Joined the Council**

To Cass, the world after the Event is a sick organism. The Cabal is a virus. The Council, though imperfect, is the only immune system humanity has left. He sees control not as oppression, but as *stewardship*.

He believes the Council’s *Project Covenant* is the final firewall between civilization and collapse.

#### **Involvement**

* **Project:** *Anima* (Neuracore Industries).
* **Responsibility:** Oversees compliance of neural firmware across the sector, including testing of “neural harmonics” designed to align personality to lawful empathy.
* **Moral Strain:** Recently discovered that his sister’s neural signature is still active—embedded in a data anomaly tagged *Mirrorwake-9*.

#### **How Players Meet Him**

The players first encounter Cass as a field executive investigating a rogue cyberclinic in the undercity (possibly one the PCs are hired to protect or extract). He’s formal, but not cruel—his calm, logical demeanor hides grief. When he realizes one of the Cabal agents behind the clinic uses his sister’s neural pattern, he freezes instead of firing.

Over time, Cass becomes a reluctant ally—providing access, protection, or information if he can believe the PCs are working toward “a cleaner world.”
