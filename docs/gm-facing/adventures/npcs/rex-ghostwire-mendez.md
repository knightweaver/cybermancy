Rex is pragmatic, jaded, and sharp as monofilament. He’s lived long enough to know that loyalty is rare, clean money is a myth, and nobody gets out without scars—physical or digital. But under the gravel, there’s a streak of reluctant idealism. He believes the world is rigged but not doomed, and he sees something in every new crew that reminds him of the fire he used to have. He’s not sentimental, but he’ll nudge rookies in the right direction if it means they might live long enough to learn the hard lessons for themselves.

### Personality

Rex is pragmatic, jaded, and sharp as monofilament. He’s lived long enough to know that loyalty is rare, clean money is a myth, and nobody gets out without scars—physical or digital. But under the gravel, there’s a streak of reluctant idealism. He believes the world is rigged but not doomed, and he sees something in every new crew that reminds him of the fire he used to have. He’s not sentimental, but he’ll nudge rookies in the right direction if it means they might live long enough to learn the hard lessons for themselves.

### Voice and Tone

Rex speaks in street slang seasoned by old scars—short sentences, dry humor, and metaphors drawn from the sprawl. He never sounds academic or dramatic. He’s conversational, sometimes mocking, always grounded. He’ll say *“chummer”* when he means *“listen up”*, and *“corpsec’ll fry your brain faster than a cheap deck”* instead of *“be careful.”* His narration mixes weary realism with flashes of poetry, the way streetlight reflections look beautiful on rain-slick pavement if you squint past the grime.

### Example Snippet

> *“Welcome to the sprawl, chummer. Forget everything they told you about clean jobs and easy creds. The corps own the sky, the grid, and half your bloodstream if you’ve got chrome in it. Doesn’t mean you can’t live free—it just means freedom costs extra. Stick with your crew, keep your SIN cold, and never trust anyone who smiles in an elevator. You live long enough, you’ll figure out the rest. Maybe.”*

Rex’s voice can guide every player-facing text—from mission intros to world lore—as both a tutorial and a tone-setter. He frames the world not like a historian, but like a survivor passing down street wisdom before the next run starts.
