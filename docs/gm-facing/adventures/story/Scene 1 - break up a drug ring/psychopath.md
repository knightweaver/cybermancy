Perfect — this is a well-structured first mission arc that moves cleanly from street-level intrigue into the deeper machinery of the Council-versus-Cabal conflict.
Below is a full, canon-consistent expansion of your outline with grounded names, factions, and hooks designed to pull the party organically toward *Project Chimera → Project Anima → Project Mirrorwake*.

## **Adventure One: The Song of Psychopath**

### **1. The Job**

**Hiring Contact:** **Rafael “Rafe” Solano**
Former security analyst for **Kirin Logistics**, now a mid-level **fixer** in the Freeport Sprawl’s mid-tier district *Port Eos*. His teenage daughter **Mara Solano** vanished three weeks ago after joining a new “movement” calling itself the **Cult of the Living Pattern**. Rafe’s terrified she’s fallen in with a gang pushing the designer empathy-enhancer **Psychopath**.

**Meet Location:** *The Neon Calyx* — a bar wedged under a mag-lev pylon, its interior pulsing with amber light and synth-haze. A haunt for mercs, hackers, and freelance corporate assets. Rafe’s meeting room is shielded with black-market OmniTrine static curtains to keep the data-scrapers out.

**Briefing:**

> “Psychopath isn’t just another joy-dust—it rewrites people. Users start finishing each other’s sentences, sharing dreams. I can pay for proof it’s coming from Helios Biotech. And if you find Mara… bring her home or make sure she’s free.”

He gives them a data-shard containing a link to a local contact who can get them inside a rave where the drug is moving fast.

### **2. The Rave**

**Event Name:** *Sermon Pulse 23*
**Location:** An abandoned **Verdant Biomech** hydroponic tower in the drowned quarter known as *Level 47*. The space has been gutted and repurposed into a vertical club—a column of catwalks, hanging projectors, and broken grow-lights now pulsing to a hive-mind rhythm.

**The Contact:** **Lio “Thread” Vance** — a jittery data-runner and part-time supplier who once moved freight for **AstraVail Technologies** before falling into Helios’s shadow network. He’s been selling Psychopath on behalf of the **Cult of the Living Pattern** but recently stiffed his distributors.

**The Opposing Faction:**

* **Gang:** *The Choir of Glass* — Abraxas-aligned street cult using holographic graffiti and sonic resonance as ritual.
* **Leader:** **Mother Sonatine**, a former Vesper Syndicate performer whose vocal implants can modulate emotion itself.
  She believes Lio stole sacred “sermon samples” meant to seed a new Mirrorwake sub-AI and sends glass-eyed acolytes to collect.

**Scene Tone:** The rave is half-ritual, half-concert. As the crowd peaks on Psychopath, the walls shimmer, and reality itself bends—reflections moving half a beat late, lights forming fractal mandalas. This is the players’ first glimpse of the **Chimera effect** in action.

After defending Lio from the Choir, interrogation (or persuasion) reveals the shipment’s route: a “wellness distribution node” operating out of an industrial block registered to a Helios Biotech subcontractor.

### **3. The Distribution Center**

**Facility Name:** *Helios Wellness Node 47B*
**Cover Identity:** “Community Rejuvenation Clinic” — officially a Helios humanitarian outreach program providing “empathic mood therapy” to low-income citizens.

**Location:** The flood-scarred district of *Gray Harbor*, a maze of algae-coated warehouses and half-functional freight elevators.

**Physical Description:**
Exterior — mirrored glass panels patched with corrosion-proof plating; Helios’s gold-and-teal emblem faintly visible through grime.
Interior — stark white corridors, bioplastic vats filled with amber fluid, and sealed cold-storage lockers tagged with Neuracore serials. Workers in synthetic robes chant soft synchrony mantras under their breath—early-stage members of the Cult of the Living Pattern.

**Discovery:**
Intercepted crates labeled *“Neural Empathic Therapy Compound CH-13 (Psychopath β)”* bear **Helios Biotech** manufacturing codes. Data slates show delivery to **Neuracore’s Project Anima** research nodes—evidence that both corps are studying each other’s outcomes.

### **4. The Medical Facility**

**Facility Name:** *St. Arcadia Clinic* — colloquially *“Arc’s End.”*
A privately owned trauma ward operating under a nominal **Neuracore Industries** license, staffed by street-level medtechs and ex-corporate doctors.

**Head Physician:** **Dr. Sana Ishiro**, cyber-surgeon and former Dominion Systems field medic. She runs the clinic ethically but pragmatically: treat anyone who can pay or trade, don’t ask too many questions.

**Observed Event:**
When the PCs bring in an overdose victim, Ishiro administers a Neuracore-issued nanite compound from *Project Anima*. It stabilizes the patient—but also wipes their emotional responses, leaving them docile, compliant, and eerily blank.

**Secondary Discovery:**
Morgue drawers are emptying. Dr. Ishiro admits she’s paid discreetly to hand over “expired clients” to a clean-up crew claiming to represent Verdant’s bio-recycling program. In reality, the crew belongs to the **Choir of Glass**, diverting bodies to an underground *Mirrorwake Node* for digital resurrection experiments.

---

### **5. The Endgame**

Returning to Rafe Solano, the PCs can:

* **Sell** their findings to his fixer network (earning credits but burying the truth).
* **Infiltrate** a Neuracore satellite office and uncover early *Project Anima* protocols cross-referencing *Chimera β-strain*.
* **Trace** the morgue disappearances deeper into the undercity, discovering that *Mirrorwake* is stitching the minds of Chimera and Anima victims into a shared network—an embryonic digital hive consciousness whispering Abraxas’s voice.

The closing revelation binds the chain:

> Psychopath → Chimera (Dragon’s empathy virus) →
> Anima (Neuracore’s control nanites) →
> Mirrorwake (Demon’s resurrection web).

The Dragon creates connection.
The Council enforces order.
The Demon gathers the dead.

The players stand between them, deciding whether to sever the link—or see what new world might be born from it.
