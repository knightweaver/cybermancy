Electronic surveillance kit,electronic-surveillance-kit,"Give your Primary Drone the ability to eavesdrop on electric signals within Very Far.  If those signals are encrypted, you must make a Knowledge check against the Environment Difficulty to decrypt.","Modular sensor array for passive RF interception, short-range IMSI/SSID scanning, and analog audio pickup. Provides packet capture, signal fingerprinting, and buffered evidence storage; legal and ethical constraints apply.",1,class-rigger,item,electronic-surveillance-kit
Extra weapon,extra-weapon,"Your Primary Drone gains an extra attack, d6+2",Auxiliary hardpoint for mounting compact kinetic or directed-energy arms (pistol-class). Integrated recoil dampening and fire-control link; increases lethality at cost of power draw and signature.,2,class-rigger,item,extra-weapon
Grenade,grenade,Place a token on this card and remove 1 grenade from your inventory.  Your Primary Drone now has the ability to launch that grenade as an attack action .,"Single-use payload dispenser compatible with fragmentation, flashbang, or EMP cartridges. Designed for one-shot delivery with programmable fuse timing; blast radius and collateral effects vary by munition type.  A new token can only be applied as a action or during a rest.",2,class-rigger,item,grenade
Rocket launcher,rocket-launcher,Place 1 token on this card and remove 1 rocket from your inventory (must be acquired or built during a long rest).  Your Primary Drone now has the ability to launch that rocket as an attack action.  ,Tube-mounted single-shot launcher for small rockets or breaching charges. High structural and recoil load; intended for anti-vehicle or fortification breaching tasks and requires operator authorization.,3,class-rigger,item,rocket-launcher
Extra armor,extra-armor,"+1 Armor, +2 / +2 to Major and Severe damage thresholds, -1 Evasion",Composite plating upgrade that increases drone ballistic and fragmentation resistance. ,2,class-rigger,item,extra-armor
Submersible,submersible,"Your Primary Drone gains a watertight hull and sealed propulsion package enabling limited underwater operation. Supports shallow submersion, periscope comms, and buoyancy control; not rated for deep-sea pressures.",,1,class-rigger,item,submersible
Signal jammer,signal-jammer,Your Primary Drone gains a signal jammer such that all comms (ally and adversary) within Close are effectively jammed.  All other drones within Very Close can no longer receive signal or commands.,Active RF emitter that disrupts selected frequency bands within a defined radius. Effective against unsecured comms and simple remote control links; high power use and easily traced.,2,class-rigger,item,signal-jammer
Signal booster,signal-booster,Your Primary Drone can now operate anywhere within the Scene and is invulnerable to signal jamming if within Close of you.,High-gain relay and phased antenna array that extends line-of-sight comms and uplink resilience. Improves datarate and range for swarm coordination; increases RF detectability.,2,class-rigger,item,signal-booster
Melee weapon,melee-weapon,"Your drone gains an extra Melee range attack, damage: d8+3",Compact melee attachment modeled on Southeast Asian blades (keris/kris-style dagger). Designed for close-quarters utility and nonlethal deterrence when fitted with blunt or taser-tip variants; carries cultural resonance in certain districts.,1,class-rigger,item,melee-weapon
Grappling device,grappling-device,Your Primary Drone has an embedded grappling hook and 10m of cable.,"Winch and tether system with motorized spool for anchoring or lifting small loads. Provides up to X kg dynamic pull (specify model), includes load sensors and auto-retract safety cutout.",1,class-rigger,item,grappling-device
Storage locker,storage-locker,"Your Primary Drone  gains an internal modular cargo bay with secure locking and temperature stabilization. Supports mission-specific payloads, evidence retention, and concealment; access controlled via cryptographic key.","Internal modular cargo bay with secure locking and temperature stabilization. Supports mission-specific payloads, evidence retention, and concealment; access controlled via cryptographic key.",1,class-rigger,item,storage-locker
Digger,digger,Your Primary Drone gaines the ability to burrow through soil at a rate of 3m / minute.,Compact excavation kit with rotary auger and soil displacement sensors for shallow burrowing or substrate sampling. Suited for covert emplacement or forensic retrieval; limited by ground composition and energy budget.,2,class-rigger,item,digger
Chemical analysis tool,chemical-analysis-tool,Your Primary Drone gains the ability to constantly monitor environment within Close for any chemical hazards and can detect explosives as well.,"Onboard spectrometer suite (FTIR/GC-MS microvariant) for rapid field profiling of liquids, vapors, and residues. Returns compound matches and confidence scores; requires consumables and calibration for high-accuracy results.",1,class-rigger,item,chemical-analysis-tool
Stealth shield,stealth-shield,Your Primary Drone gains the ability to trigger the Hidden condition as an action.  That condition persists until it takes any other action.,"Adaptive material overlay and EM-absorbent coating that reduces radar, LiDAR, and thermal signatures. Lowers detection probability at cost of increased power draw and reduced heat dissipation.",3,class-rigger,item,stealth-shield
Portable barrier,portable-barrier,"Your Primary Drone gains the ability to deploy a linear barrier.  Any creature can gain the Hidden condition by crouching down behind the barrier, but the drone may now gain the Hidden condition from its own portable barrier.",Deployable modular barrier (inflatable or rigid-panel) for instant cover and crowd control. Provides temporary line-of-sight obstruction and blast attenuation; assembly time and emplacement footprint vary by model.,2,class-rigger,item,portable-barrier
Telescope,telescope,"Your Primary Drone gains the ability to see with a 20x optical zoom, plus an additional 10x digital zoom allowing it to see and capture high quality images and video within 400m",High-resolution optical zoom assembly with motorized stabilization and focus.
