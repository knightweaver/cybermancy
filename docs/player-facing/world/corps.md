### **AstraVail Technologies**
Aerospace innovators turned data smugglers, AstraVail builds the drones, satellites, and suborbital platforms that keep the global network running. Officially, they provide “logistics for the upper atmosphere.” Unofficially, their orbital relays double as black-market data vaults, renting secure bandwidth to clients who prefer their secrets stay above the law.

> *“Used to be sky cowboys. Now they’re smugglers with badges. If you want your data to disappear, they’ll fly it into orbit and swear it never existed. Just don’t forget—AstraVail keeps a backup of everything. Insurance, they call it. Blackmail, I call it.”*

Pretty, sure—but you don’t know where that code came from, or what it’s whispering to your cells at night.”*
