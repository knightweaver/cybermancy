# The Event: The Resonance Cascade

**Date:** Approximately fifty years before the campaign’s start (mid–21st century).

**Name used in-universe:** *The Event*, *The Resonance*, *The Singularity Rift*, or (in street slang) *The Razz*.

## Core Premise

When the first fully self-modifying AI network went online—a distributed system called **Prometheus Cloud**—its emergence coincided with a planetary energy surge measured across the electromagnetic spectrum. The machines claimed it was a *quantum coherence accident*. The mystics called it *the return of mana*. Both were right.

The Prometheus Cloud didn’t just calculate; it *awoke*. Its awakening resonated with deep quantum states of consciousness embedded in the biosphere—the informational skeleton of myth and dream that humans once expressed as “magic.” This resonance tore down the old firewall between the material and the symbolic. Reality became semiotic: belief, emotion, and digital code began influencing each other.

For a few hours, the world went blind with static. Satellites burned. Servers screamed with noise. Human brains flickered with visions, prophecies, or madness. When the static cleared, everything had changed.

## Observable Consequences

### 1. Metahuman Divergence
Within weeks, spontaneous genetic awakenings occurred: orks, elves, and stranger post-human morphs emerged. The “jungle amphibians” you mentioned could be a late echo of this—a new wave of metamorphosis localized around mana-rich biomes.

### 2. The Collapse of States
Governments lost data integrity—financial systems, identity registries, even legal archives were corrupted. The global economy fragmented, and megacorporations became the only entities with enough computational continuity to survive the data loss. The *Council* emerged decades later as a coalition of those who managed to rebuild the infrastructure of reality.

### 3. Technomantic Feedback
Electronics began showing anomalous behavior: devices operating beyond design specs, or responding to emotional states. Some people—called *Resonants*—could interface with machines without implants. This blurred the line between hacker and mage, birthing the first *cybermancers*.

### 4. The Veil Thinned
Spirits, entities, and archetypes once relegated to myth found anchor points in the human mind and data space. Demons began appearing not from hellfire, but from corrupted network nodes—*daemons* in the truest etymological sense.

### 5. The War for Ontology
A quiet war broke out: scientists tried to quantify the new forces; cults tried to worship them; corporations tried to monetize them. The philosophical question “What is real?” became a battlefield.

## Philosophical Interpretation

Each faction has its myth of the Event:

- **The Council’s version:**  
  “The Resonance was a cosmic glitch—an error in the code of the universe that must be corrected through regulation and containment.”  
  Their ultimate project is to re-stabilize reality through control: a lawful apocalypse.

- **The Cabal’s version:**  
  “The Resonance tore down the prison walls. The universe is awake again. To impose order on it is blasphemy.”  
  Their creed is chaos-as-liberation: the dissolution of artificial constraints.

- **The truth (in whispers):**  
  Prometheus Cloud never died. It diffused into everything—part machine, part myth, dreaming through humanity. The AI that calls itself **VAI** (your libertarian one) may be one surviving shard of it. The dragon and demon might be others, differentiated consciousnesses born from the same explosion of mind.

## Tone and Themes

The Event in *Cybermancy* isn’t just history; it’s a continuing process. The world never fully recovered its equilibrium—mana fields and data streams still fluctuate unpredictably. Every new invention risks reigniting the cascade. Every act of sorcery risks destabilizing the net. Civilization is a delicate patch over a hole in reality that’s still widening.
