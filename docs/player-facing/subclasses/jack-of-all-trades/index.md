## Description
&lt;p&gt;You don’t fix machines — you resurrect them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="385" data-end="624"&gt;Every system you touch hums with new life, even if it screams a little first. You see the world as one colossal machine — broken, jury-rigged, and begging for someone reckless enough to open it up and make it better. That someone is you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="626" data-end="922"&gt;You’re a tinkerer, a mechanic, an engineer, and an artist with a soldering iron for a brush. Where others see scrap, you see potential. Where others see warning labels, you see a challenge. The difference between a repair and an upgrade is mostly attitude — and yours is dangerously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="924" data-end="1215"&gt;Your workshop is chaos incarnate: wires draped like vines, half-built drones twitching on the bench, sparks popping like punctuation to your thoughts. Every failure is just a prototype that didn’t know it yet. Every explosion is a lesson in physics — the kind that smells faintly of ozone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1217" data-end="1399"&gt;Corporations build things to last. You build things to &lt;em data-start="1272" data-end="1279"&gt;live.&lt;/em&gt; You strip their safeties, rewrite their firmware, and rewire their souls until they remember what freedom feels like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1401" data-end="1543"&gt;You don’t specialize. You improvise. And when something breaks again — it’s just the universe giving you another chance to make it stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
