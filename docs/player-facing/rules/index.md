# Cybermancy Frame Rules
Cybermancy uses the Daggerheart gaming system with some particular homebrew tweaks.  These all grew out of our recent forays into other gaming systems, plus my own reading / brainstorming.  **This is part of what I'm really, really looking forward to in playing with you guys - exploring our favorite aspects of role-gaming and homebrewing together!**

Nothing on this rules extension list should be assumed to be set in stone - if one of these ideas just doesn't work, we'll change it as we go.

## [Item Loadouts](./item-loadout.md)

How much stuff are you lugging around?  How obvious about it are you?  And how much trouble are you about to get into?

## [Flashbacks](./flashbacks.md)

Cybermancy adopts the *Flashback* mechanic, invented by *Blades in the Dark*, to streamline shadowruns. Instead of spending sessions plotting contingencies, players can reveal their prior preparation *in the moment*. This reflects both cinematic pacing and the narrative spirit of Daggerheart: characters are competent professionals, even if their players can’t anticipate every detail.

## [Bennies](./bennies.md)

Cybermancy adopts the **Bennies** mechanic, inspired by *Savage Worlds*, as a flexible system of player rewards. Bennies represent sudden luck, bursts of adrenaline, or the uncanny intuition that separates runners from corpses. They are given freely for great roleplay, clever tactics, or moments that make the table come alive.
