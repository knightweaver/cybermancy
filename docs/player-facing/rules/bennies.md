Cybermancy adopts the **Bennies** mechanic, inspired by *Savage Worlds*, as a flexible system of player rewards. Bennies represent sudden luck, bursts of adrenaline, or the uncanny intuition that separates runners from corpses. They are given freely for great roleplay, clever tactics, or moments that make the table come alive.

While similar to “Inspiration” from *Dungeons & Dragons*, Bennies offer broader uses and appear more frequently, reinforcing the cinematic flow of the game.

## Core Rules

- **Starting Pool:** Each player begins every session with **1 Bennie**.  
- **Earning Bennies:** The GM may award Bennies at their discretion for actions that make the story more engaging—bold moves, in-character choices, teamwork, or memorable improvisation. They should be awarded generously.  
- **Expiration:** Unused Bennies expire at the end of the session.

## Spending Bennies

A Bennie may be spent at any time to gain one of the following benefits:

1. **Recover 1 Stress** — regain composure or shake off exhaustion.  
2. **Re-roll either your Hope die or your Fear die** — fate bends briefly in your favor.  
3. **Gain an additional Reaction** — act when instinct takes over.  
4. **Add +d6 to damage** — push past limits for a decisive strike.

> Luck’s a liar, kid—but she’s useful if you know how to work her. Bennies aren’t magic. They’re those split-second choices that keep you breathing when the odds say you shouldn’t be.
>
> Maybe it’s a reflex, maybe it’s instinct, maybe it’s just stubborn refusal to die. Doesn’t matter. You burn a Bennie when the universe should’ve ended you but didn’t.
>
> Earn ’em by making the story worth watching—pull a stunt, crack a joke, take a risk. Spend ’em when the dice turn mean. In the sprawl, style buys survival, and Bennies are how the cosmos tips its hat when you make it look good.

### Design Intent

Bennies exist to reward play that enhances the experience for everyone at the table. They turn cinematic moments into tangible advantage, reinforcing the tone of Cybermancy—where style, nerve, and luck often matter as much as firepower.
