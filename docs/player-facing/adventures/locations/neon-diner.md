### Background

The Neon Diner sits on the edge of South Verge, where the glow of the corporate skyline fades into the damp haze of forgotten industry. It’s an anachronism—a chrome-and-glass relic from the pre-Resonance era, when people still believed in breakfast specials and second chances. The sign out front flickers in three colors that never match, buzzing louder than the air recyclers, casting pink ghosts across the rain-slick street.

It survived when everything else around it didn’t. The old mag-rail line that used to feed the morning rush collapsed years ago, and the corporate blocks stopped sending inspectors once the gangs started charging tolls. The only reason the Diner’s still open is because it sits at the crossroads of half a dozen data-pipe access points—a neutral zone where you can grab synth-eggs, patch a signal, and trade information without getting fragged. The city runs on rumor, and *The Neon Diner* is one of its servers.
