## Description
*<p><em>After the Razz, reality is more of a suggestion than a hard fact.</em><span style="mso-spacerun:yes"><em>  </em></span><em>No one knows what the Promethius Cloud unleashed, whether this is some new quantum state of reality in which everything is in a superposition Schrodinger state or some new rules of physics that we just don’t fully understand , but the result is that the old rules no longer apply.</em><span style="mso-spacerun:yes"><em>  </em></span><em>More than anything the new state of reality has made it clear that the universe runs I'm a complicated system and the source code has been laid bare to your eyes.And that’s where you come in.</em><span style="mso-spacerun:yes"><em>  </em></span><em>You can see the shifting patterns of quantum probability, they are everywhere.</em><span style="mso-spacerun:yes"><em>  </em></span><em>Yeah, some people like to call them “mana”, “spiritual energy”, or some other mumbo jumbo, but you recognize them as the echoing resonances of the original Resonance.</em></p><p><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><em>Some Cybermancers love nothing more than to encourage and amplify the chaos that has come after the resonance and others seemed to make it their mission to try to return things back to normal” (whatever that means). But regardless they are all grabbing twisting and manipulating something that they really don't understand.</em></p>*

## Subclasses
- <a href='../../subclasses/amplifier/'><img src='../../../assets/icons/subclasses/amplifier.webp' alt='Amplifier' class='item-image' style='width:120px; height:auto;'></a><br> <a href='../../subclasses/amplifier/'><strong>Amplifier</strong></a> — _Subclass_: <p><em>You believe chaos is not the enemy—it’s the engine. The Prometheus Cloud didn’t destroy the old world; it evolved it. Every surge of entropy, every collapse of structure, is another chance to grow something new. You are the frequency that pushes the system beyond stability, into transformation.</em></p><p><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><em>Amplifiers channel the Resonance into explosive expressions of energy and emotion. They heighten reality’s volatility, magnifying both danger and possibility. When you act, probability curves toward drama—fires burn brighter, shots hit harder, and coincidences pile up into fate.</em></p><p><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><em><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Entropy is evolution. The world improves through destruction and rebirth.<br /><strong>Drive:</strong> Ignite transformation through chaos and connection.</em></p><p><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><em><strong>Narrative Hook:</strong> Amplifiers often become cult icons, revolutionaries, or chaos-artists. They believe the Resonance is alive—and they’re its favorite instrument.</em></p>
- <a href='../../subclasses/dampener/'><img src='../../../assets/icons/subclasses/dampener.webp' alt='Dampener' class='item-image' style='width:120px; height:auto;'></a><br> <a href='../../subclasses/dampener/'><strong>Dampener</strong></a> — _Subclass_: <p>To you, chaos is noise—meaningless vibration that hides the true signal. The Prometheus Cloud shattered the lattice of reality, but you can still sense its intended structure. You hear the hum of stability beneath the static and dedicate yourself to restoring it.</p><p><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">Dampeners manipulate the field to filter, balance, and silence uncontrolled probability. They stabilize allies, suppress dangerous phenomena, and bring calm where others only see confusion. But the more control they impose, the more they risk cutting themselves off from the living rhythm of the Resonance itself.</p><p><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Stability is strength. Chaos without form is suffering.<br /><strong>Drive:</strong> Contain, heal, and preserve coherence.</p>

## Features
- <a href='../../features/ride-the-wave/'><img src='../../../assets/icons/features/ride-the-wave.webp' alt='Ride the wave' class='item-image' style='width:120px; height:auto;'></a><br> <a href='../../features/ride-the-wave/'><strong>Ride the wave</strong></a> — _Hope_: Spend 3 Hope to force an adversary within Far to re-roll a Spellcasting check of any type.
- <a href='../../features/feedback-loop/'><img src='../../../assets/icons/features/feedback-loop.webp' alt='Feedback Loop' class='item-image' style='width:120px; height:auto;'></a><br> <a href='../../features/feedback-loop/'><strong>Feedback Loop</strong></a> — _Class_: When an ally fails a roll, as a Reaction, Spend 1 Hope to make a Spellcasting (15) and on a success turn their failure it into a Success with Fear.
- <a href='../../features/fractal-surge/'><img src='../../../assets/icons/features/fractal-surge.webp' alt='Fractal Surge' class='item-image' style='width:120px; height:auto;'></a><br> <a href='../../features/fractal-surge/'><strong>Fractal Surge</strong></a> — _Class_: Once per scene, unleash a burst of raw probability.  
o	All Devices within Very Close gain -2 to their Hacking Difficulty 
o	All adversary electronic systems gain Disadvantage on their attack rolls until the GM spends 1 Fear to end that effect.
- <a href='../../features/detect-anomaly/'><img src='../../../assets/icons/features/detect-anomaly.webp' alt='Detect anomaly' class='item-image' style='width:120px; height:auto;'></a><br> <a href='../../features/detect-anomaly/'><strong>Detect anomaly</strong></a> — _Class_: You are highly attuned to the presence of effects that attempt to alter the local Resonance.  Spend an action concentrating to detect if there are any anomalies within Close.  Spend at least 1 minute concentrating to detect information about any anomalies within Very Close – you may ask the GM up to 3 yes/no questions about an resonance field disturbance you detect and examine in this way.
