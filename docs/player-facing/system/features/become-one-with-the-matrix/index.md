## Description
*<p>Once per long rest, you delve so deeply, that you can almost see the System as a whole from the inside. Start a counter at your Tier level (which by the time you are at Mastery, will be a d8 or d10). While that counter is in effect:</p><ul><li><p>+6 on all Analyze rolls</p></li><li><p>+4 on all Infiltration rolls</p></li><li><p>+2 on all Control rolls</p></li><li><p>+d4 on all damage effects</p></li><li><p>Cybernetic devices can be targeted as if they were regular devices.</p></li></ul><p>Tick down the die by 1 for each Action you take.</p>*
