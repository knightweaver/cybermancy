# Bodyguard

## Description
*<p>Your loyalty is your armor. Your purpose is protection.</p><p><br /></p><p data-start="2318" data-end="2536">You stand between chaos and the one who hired you — a wall of muscle, will, and immaculate reflexes. You’re not just a shield; you’re the counterattack that happens before anyone even realizes they’ve made a mistake.</p><p><br /></p><p data-start="2538" data-end="2731">You read rooms like battlegrounds. You count exits without looking. You memorize heartbeats. The people you protect might never know how close they came to dying — and that’s how you like it.</p><p><br /></p><p data-start="2733" data-end="2925">You don’t protect because you’re paid to. You protect because it gives you meaning. In a city that sells everything, loyalty’s the one currency that still has value — and yours is priceless.</p><p><br /></p><p data-start="2927" data-end="3008">When the bullets start flying, you don’t dive for cover.<br data-start="2983" data-end="2986" />You <em data-start="2990" data-end="2995">are</em> the cover.</p>*
