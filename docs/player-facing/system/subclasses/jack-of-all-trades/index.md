# Jack of All Trades

## Description
*<p>You don’t fix machines — you resurrect them.</p><p></p><p data-start="385" data-end="624">Every system you touch hums with new life, even if it screams a little first. You see the world as one colossal machine — broken, jury-rigged, and begging for someone reckless enough to open it up and make it better. That someone is you.</p><p></p><p data-start="626" data-end="922">You’re a tinkerer, a mechanic, an engineer, and an artist with a soldering iron for a brush. Where others see scrap, you see potential. Where others see warning labels, you see a challenge. The difference between a repair and an upgrade is mostly attitude — and yours is dangerously optimistic.</p><p></p><p data-start="924" data-end="1215">Your workshop is chaos incarnate: wires draped like vines, half-built drones twitching on the bench, sparks popping like punctuation to your thoughts. Every failure is just a prototype that didn’t know it yet. Every explosion is a lesson in physics — the kind that smells faintly of ozone.</p><p></p><p data-start="1217" data-end="1399">Corporations build things to last. You build things to <em data-start="1272" data-end="1279">live.</em> You strip their safeties, rewrite their firmware, and rewire their souls until they remember what freedom feels like.</p><p data-start="1401" data-end="1543">You don’t specialize. You improvise. And when something breaks again — it’s just the universe giving you another chance to make it stronger.</p>*
