    ## Description
    &lt;i&gt;Mercy jammed with the trigger.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p class="Card-Feature"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark 4 Stress&lt;/strong&gt;Attack all targets within Very Far in a 90 degree cone.  Make 1 Attack roll at +2 against the first target, which must be at the left or right side of the cone, and all subsequent target is in the natural order sweeping through the cone.  Subtract 1 from that value for the second target and subtract 1 more for each subsequent target.  (So, 1 roll of the Destiny dice, but the value is applied to all targets, starting at +2 and going down by 1 for each target after the first). Gun is emptied afterward and you must take an Action to reload before you can make another Attack action.&lt;/p&gt;
